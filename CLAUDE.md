## READ THIS FIRST

This is the single source of truth for Axis. Load at the start of every Claude Code or Cursor session. Update after every significant session — what changed, what broke, what was decided and why.

**Current status:** Backend live on Railway. React frontend live on Vercel. Brain dump working end to end. Gmail OAuth and intelligence loop not yet built.

**The rule:** Build on and tweak what exists. Never full redesign. Every session moves forward.

## 1. WHAT AXIS IS

### One sentence
Axis is an ambient AI agent that reads your email, calendar, health, location, and finances continuously — and communicates back through one persistent thread, smart notifications, and a lock screen widget. You stop managing your phone. It manages your life.

### The core insight
Every productivity app makes you more phone-dependent. Axis inverts this. Your phone already has all the data needed to run your life. Axis is the AI that reads it, handles 95% silently, and surfaces only what genuinely needs you — at the right moment, on the right surface, with the action pre-prepared.

### The slogan
**Be phone lazy. Be world productive.**

### The goal
8 minutes of phone time per day. 3 deliberate sessions. Everything else handled.

### Product score
- **Current build (brain dump only):** 6/10
- **With Gmail + Calendar OAuth + intelligence loop:** 8.5/10
- **With Android NotificationListenerService:** 9.5/10
- **After Apple acquisition (native OS access):** 9.5/10 on iOS

### Acquisition target
**Apple** — 18-month window. iOS 8.5 proves the concept. Android 9.5 is the acquisition demo. Apple is the only company that can complete the last 1 point natively on iOS.

## 2. THE UX ARCHITECTURE

### Core principle
**Axis is the HQ. Everything else is a surface that points back to HQ.**

The app is the command centre — the thread, brain dump, skills, day plan. But most users most of the time should never need to open it. They get what they need from the lock screen widget, a smart notification, or Siri. When they do open the app, it's deliberate.

**Axis comes to you. You go to Axis only when you choose to.**

### The surfaces

| Surface | Tech | Phase | What it shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| The Thread (HQ) | SwiftUI / React | Phase 1 | Persistent iMessage-style conversation. Axis messages you proactively. |
| Lock screen widget | WidgetKit | Phase 1 | One signal — most important action right now. Interactive buttons (mark done, snooze). |
| Smart notifications | APNs + action buttons | Phase 1 | Context-aware pushes with pre-prepared actions. [Send] [Edit] [Later] |
| Siri voice capture | App Intents framework | Phase 1 | "Hey Siri, add to Axis: call supplier Thursday." Hands-free input. |
| Dynamic Island | ActivityKit | Phase 2 | Live agent status — what Axis is reading right now. |
| Apple Watch | ClockKit | Phase 3 | One-tap done. Current signal. Haptic alerts. |
| macOS menu bar | NSStatusBar | Phase 3 | Current signal in one line. Click to expand thread. |

### The interaction patterns

**Pattern 1: Axis reads → you act**
Axis reads Gmail, Calendar, Health, GPS continuously. Detects what matters. Surfaces via notification or thread message with action pre-prepared. You tap one button.
Example: "Marcus replied — high intent, draft ready." [Send] [Edit]

**Pattern 2: You speak → Axis handles**
Voice capture via Siri, brain dump text, or Share Extension. You give Axis raw information. It structures, prioritises, and adds to thread or task list.
Example: "Hey Siri, brain dump in Axis: waterproof membrane failing on Level 2, need to reorder"

**Pattern 3: Widget → deep link**
Every widget tap goes exactly to the right place — not the app home screen. Signal widget opens that specific task. Email widget opens the draft.

**Pattern 4: One tap done**
Every surface has a one-tap action. The user almost never types. Axis pre-prepares everything.

### The ideal Axis day (target state)

```
6:50 AM  Morning digest push arrives while user is asleep
7:00 AM  Session 1 (3 min) — open thread, handle 4 things with 4 taps. "Put the phone down."
8:30 AM  GPS triggers Builder mode. Widget updates. Site context loads.
9:15 AM  Hands-free: "Hey Siri, tell Axis: membrane failing on Level 2, call supplier"
10:00 AM Meeting prep notification 30 min before — key points from recent email with Marcus
12:30 PM Session 2 (3 min) — midday check, brain dump loose thoughts
5:30 PM  Finance alert: "Invoice #47 overdue 14 days" [Send reminder] → done in 3 seconds
6:00 PM  Session 3 (2 min) — end of day, tomorrow's signal set. "You're done. Put the phone down."

Total phone time: ~8 minutes
```

## 3. THE INTELLIGENCE ARCHITECTURE

### The 5-layer system

```
Layer 1 — Data ingestion
Gmail OAuth · Google Calendar · Apple Calendar (EventKit) · HealthKit · CoreLocation
Stripe/Xero · Slack OAuth · Contacts graph · Brain dump text · Siri voice · Share Extension

↓ every 15 min · on change · on GPS trigger

Layer 2 — Context assembly (backend)
New inputs since last run · User model (learned patterns) · Current mode + location
Health context · Today's calendar · Relationship graph · Last 10 thread messages

↓ assembled into one structured prompt

Layer 3 — Claude processing (claude-sonnet-4-5)
Dispatch job · Email ranker · Morning digest · Meeting prep · Signal ranker · Voice model

↓ returns structured JSON with routing instructions

Layer 4 — Output routing
Push notification + action buttons · Lock screen widget update · Thread message
Dynamic Island · Signal queue update · Silent (handled, no interrupt)

↓ user acts (or doesn't)

Layer 5 — Feedback loop
Every action logged → user model updated weekly → Claude calls improve → better decisions
```

### The dispatch job (the heartbeat)
Runs every 15 minutes on Railway. Pulls new data from all connected OAuth sources. Assembles context. Calls Claude once. Routes outputs to correct surfaces. This is what makes Axis feel "always watching."

**Claude's job in the dispatch job:** Make decisions, not suggestions. For each input: urgency score (1-10), actionable (bool), surface to route to, action to pre-prepare, one-sentence reason. Return structured JSON only.

### The routing rules

| Urgency | Actionable? | Goes to | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8-10/10 | Yes | Push notification immediately | High-intent email reply |
| 8-10/10 | No | Push + thread | Meeting location changed |
| 6-7/10 | Yes | Push during business hours | Overdue invoice |
| 5-6/10 | Yes | Morning digest | Meeting prep for tomorrow |
| 3-5/10 | Info | Morning digest | Health context |
| 1-2/10 | No | Silent | Newsletters, low-value emails |

**95% of what Axis processes never reaches the user.** That's the product.

---

## 4. THE MEMORY ARCHITECTURE

### Three layers of memory

**Layer 1 — Session context (expires 48hrs)**
Fast access for every Claude call. Current mode, today's calendar, last 10 messages, health context, active tasks.

**Layer 2 — User model (never expires, grows forever)**
Everything Axis has learned about this specific person:
- Voice patterns: sentence length, formality by recipient type, sign-offs, common phrases
- Relationship graph: contact importance scores, avg reply time, reply rate per contact
- Productive windows: when they actually complete tasks
- Completion rates: by category (work/health/admin etc)
- Notification response windows: when they act on pushes
- Defer patterns: what categories they consistently avoid
- Reply velocity: per contact, per category

**Layer 3 — Collective intelligence (anonymised, shared across users)**
Patterns that help new users immediately. Compounds with scale. This is the moat.

### Database tables to add (Session 4)

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_model (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id) UNIQUE,
  voice_patterns JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  relationship_graph JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  productive_windows JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  completion_rates JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  notif_response_rates JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  defer_patterns JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE interactions (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  surface TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  content_id TEXT,
  action_taken TEXT NOT NULL,
  response_time_ms INTEGER,
  mode TEXT,
  health_context JSONB,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE relationship_graph (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  contact_email TEXT NOT NULL,
  importance_score FLOAT DEFAULT 5.0,
  avg_reply_time_hrs FLOAT,
  reply_rate FLOAT,
  total_interactions INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  last_interaction TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(user_id, contact_email)
);

CREATE TABLE patterns (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  best_productive_hours JSONB,
  deferred_categories JSONB,
  notif_response_windows JSONB,
  draft_acceptance_rate FLOAT,
  email_ranking_accuracy FLOAT,
  week_of DATE,
  UNIQUE(user_id, week_of)
);

CREATE TABLE sent_emails_cache (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id),
  recipient TEXT,
  recipient_type TEXT,
  subject TEXT,
  body_summary TEXT,
  word_count INTEGER,
  formality_score FLOAT,
  sent_at TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE collective_patterns (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  mode TEXT,
  pattern_type TEXT,
  pattern_data JSONB,
  sample_size INTEGER,
  confidence FLOAT,
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## 5. THE IMPROVEMENT LOOP

Every user action is a training signal. Every week the system gets smarter automatically.

**What gets logged:** Send, edit, dismiss, defer, open, ignore — every interaction. Mode, time, health context, what was shown, response time.

**Weekly improvement job (Sunday 3AM):**
1. Analyse past 7 days of interactions
2. Compute accuracy rates for each prediction type
3. Call Claude with interaction summary
4. Claude updates user model JSON
5. Updated model feeds into all next week's Claude calls

**Voice model builder (Sunday 4AM):**
1. Pull last 50 sent emails via Gmail API
2. Analyse sentence patterns, formality by recipient type, length, phrases
3. Update voice_patterns in user_model
4. Improved drafts the following week

**Evolution timeline:**
- Day 1-3: General heuristics. Useful but generic.
- Week 1-2: Pattern detection begins. Voice matching starts.
- Week 3-4: "It knows me." Drafts sound like you.
- Month 2-3: Anticipation. Axis predicts before you ask.
- Month 6+: Genuinely irreplaceable. Switching cost = 6 months of learning.

## 7. THE THREE CRITICAL PROMPTS

### Prompt 1 — Dispatch

```python
DISPATCH_SYSTEM = """
You are Axis, an ambient AI agent for {name}.
Your job: decide what matters right now and what to do about it.
Make decisions, not suggestions. Return ONLY structured JSON.

For each item return:
{
  "urgency": 1-10,
  "actionable": true/false,
  "surface": "push|thread|widget|digest|silent",
  "action_type": "send_reply|create_task|update_widget|notify|none",
  "pre_prepared_action": "draft text or task title or notification copy",
  "reason": "one sentence"
}
"""
```

### Prompt 2 — Draft reply

```python
DRAFT_REPLY_SYSTEM = """
You are drafting an email reply on behalf of {name}.
Write EXACTLY like them. Never sound like AI.
Match their voice patterns precisely. Ready to send without editing.

Voice model: {voice_patterns}
Example past replies: {example_replies}
Email to reply to: {email_content}
Thread context: {thread_summary}
Target length: {target_word_count} words
"""
```

### Prompt 3 — Morning digest

```python
MORNING_DIGEST_SYSTEM = """
You are Axis. Generate {name}'s morning brief as thread messages.
Specific, warm, direct. Never waffle.
Max 4 messages. Each under 80 words.
End with "put the phone down."

Overnight data: {overnight_summary}
Today's calendar: {calendar_today}
Axis handled silently: {silent_count} items
"""
```

## 9. APP INTENTS (SIRI + WIDGET BUTTONS)

```
"Hey Siri, add to Axis: [text]" → thread + task queue
"Hey Siri, what's my Axis signal?" → speaks back current task
"Hey Siri, mark my Axis signal done" → marks done, advances queue
"Hey Siri, brain dump in Axis" → dictation mode, returns ranked tasks
"Hey Siri, switch Axis to Builder mode" → changes context
"Hey Siri, open Email Skill in Axis" → deep links to skill
"Hey Siri, send that Axis reply" → sends pre-drafted reply
"Hey Siri, what's in my Axis brief?" → reads back digest
```

Interactive widget buttons (iOS 17+ App Intents):
- [Done] — marks signal complete, widget updates instantly
- [Snooze] — defers 2 hours, shows next priority
- [Quick add] — opens text input from lock screen
- [Send reply] — sends pre-drafted email reply
